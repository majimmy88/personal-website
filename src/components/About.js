        San Francisco based Software Engineer with a background in Real Estate.
        Having grown up in the Bay Area, its been mesmerizing watching how much
        technology has shaped my environment. During my time in real estate, I
        helped many families buy or sell their homes and I also worked on my own
        construction projects. Now I'm moving toward a more technical challenge
        in my life and to solve problems on a larger scale. As a Software
        Engineer, I want to help create more services to empower entreprenuers
        in growing their business. If you would like to connect, please reach
        out via email or LinkedIn.
