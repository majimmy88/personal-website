        San Francisco based Software Engineer with a background in Real Estate.
        Having grown up in the Bay Area, its been amazing and mesmerizing
        watching how much technology has shaped my environment. In my 5 years of
        Real Estate, I've helped many families buy or sell their homes and I've
        also worked on my own construction projects. It was an amazing time, but
        now I'm moving toward a more technical challenge in my life and to solve
        problems on a bigger scale. As a Software Engineer, I'm looking forward
        to creating more services available via technology. If you would like to
        connect, please reach out via email or LinkedIn.
