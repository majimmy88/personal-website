        San Francisco based Software Engineer with a background in Real Estate.
        Having grown up in the Bay Area, its been mesmerizing watching how much
        technology has shaped my environment. During my time in real estate, I
        helped many families buy or sell their homes and I also worked on my own
        construction projects. It was an amazing time, but now I'm moving toward
        a more technical challenge in my life and to solve problems on a bigger
        scale. As a Software Engineer, I want to create more services to help
        entreprenuers grow their business. If you would like to connect, please
        reach out via email or LinkedIn.
