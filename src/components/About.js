        San Francisco based Software Engineer with a background in Real Estate.
        Having grown up in the Bay Area, its been amazing and mesmerizing
        watching how much technology has shaped my environment. Having spent 5
        years in Real Estate, I've helped many families buy or sell their homes
        and I've also worked on my own construction projects. It was an amazing
        time, but now I'm moving toward a more technical challenge in my life
        and to solve problems on a bigger scale. As a Software Engineer, I'm
        looking forward to creating more services and making it more available
        via technology. If you would like to connect, please reach out and we
        can hop on a call.
